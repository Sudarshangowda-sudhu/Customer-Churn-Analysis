# Customer Churn Analysis (Telecom Domain)

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem in the telecom industry, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors contributing to customer churn.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand customer churn patterns
- Identify key factors influencing churn
- Perform exploratory data analysis using visualizations
- Provide data-driven business insights for customer retention

- Contains customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and billing information

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Churn vs non-churn customer distribution
- Tenure analysis and its impact on churn
- Contract type vs churn
- Monthly charges and churn behavior
- Service usage patterns influencing churn

## 📈 Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts** have higher churn rates
- Customers with **shorter tenure** are more likely to churn
